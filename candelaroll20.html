         <p> - Did you contain or destroy a source of bleed? </p>
         <p> - Did you provide comfort or support for those affected? </p>
         <p> - Did you bring something of importance back for Candela Obscura to study? </p>
         <p>Earn 2 Illumination if some, but not all, players fulfilled an Illumination Key during the session. Earn 4 if every player fulfilled at least one Illumination Key during the session. If nobody in the circle fulfilled any of their Keys, take no additional Illumination.</p>

        <p><input type="checkbox" name="attr_circleabil1" value="1" unchecked ><b>Stamina Training:</b> Your circle has three gilded dice at the beginning of every assignment that you may add to any roll. Once a die has been rolled, it is expended.</p>
